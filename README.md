# steam-game-information

This python file lets you get information from games on the steam store,

How to use:

Enter this command on your terminal:

- python main.py {game name}
- wait

Ex: 

python main.py FOR HONORâ„¢

The name has to be EXACTLY as it appears on the steam store page.

im still trying to find a way to get the price of the game, so i will update the file once i find a way.
this is still on development so there can (probably will be) bugs.
